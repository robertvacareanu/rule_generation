# Rule Generation
Generating random rules.
The code is slightly adapted from [odinsynth2](https://github.com/marcovzla/odinsynth2).

The code is organized as follows:
- Has 3 "main" files: `main2_softrules_fstacred`, `main2_softrules_tacred`, and `main2_softrules`.
    - `main2_softrules_fstacred` -> Generates rules for the few-shot TACRED dataset
    - `main2_softrules_tacred` -> Generates rules for the TACRED dataset
    - `main2_softrules` -> Generates rules from UMBC
